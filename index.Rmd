# Overview

### Project Report

For more detailed information on the project, refer to the [project report](project_report.html) tab.

### Descriptives

One part of our project was to ask specific questions regarding COVID-19 and climate, such as how new daily COVID-19 cases and deaths change in the past year between states that are temperate and sub-tropical, red/blue states as per 2020 election, and between US cities among those are most populated compared to less populated counties. Also we wanted to see whether the important national events have an effect on the trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

### Interactive Dashboard Visualizations

In order for people to get a better idea of the trends seen in the data, we created interactive maps to allow viewers to choose what variables they would like to see and help them better visualize the information. This includes trends graphs of COVID-19 data by state over time, a map of the U.S. displaying COVID-19 and climate data for each state depending on the month and day chosen by the user, as well as a graph to visualize temperature trends by state over time.

### Predictive Models

We wanted to see the relationship between COVID-19 and climate - more specifically if the case counts is related to rise in temperature. We decided to build three model - 
The first model assess the relationship between covid-19 case counts and temperature. 
The second model assess the relationship between covid-19 case counts, temperature and its relation to school closures, work place closures and gathering restrictions. 
The thrid model assess the reltionship between covid-19 case counts and temperature and its relation to travel restrictions. 

### Interactive Predictive Tool

We went on to build a predictive tool which allows you to choose the temperature in the State that you are curious to predict the case counts and the interactive map would show you the data. 

Our second interactive predictive tools allows you to predict the case counts based on school closures, work place closures and gathering restrictions.
