# Initial Questions

Our initial questions involved looking deeper into trends in COVID-19 over the year and how those trends were affected by climate. We also wanted to see what the case counts might look like in the future based on the data that we have. To answer these broader questions, we divided into multiple smaller sections to better address more specific questions. For more information on what these initial questions looked like and how they evolved over time, please click on one of the following:

# Data

For each section, COVID-19 data were obtained from the `COVID19` package in R. Additional datasets were utilized for the analysis and are defined in the following reports.

[Regression Analysis](Regression-Analysis.html)

[Predictive Tool](predictive_tool.html)

# Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis was done in [Descriptives](descriptive_plotly.html) as well as [Interactive Dashboard Visualizations](create_shiny.html). The purpose and results

# Formal Analysis

More formal analysis was done with [Regression Analysis](Regression-Analysis.html) and [Predictive Tool](predictive_tool.html). Add more details on what that included

# Discussion
include formal discussion that is a combination of all the conclusions from other sections
