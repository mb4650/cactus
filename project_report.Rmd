# Motivation

Our motivation for CACTUS came from the idea that weather potentially had an effect on COVID-19 transmission. As weâ€™re now about to enter the winter months, it is more paramount than ever that we understand this relationship, so that the general public can be appropriately informed and take proper precaution and control measures as a result. Although climate itself most likely does not act alone in contributing to transmission, we were interested in further understanding the association between various climate variables and COVID-19 statistics. Our project utilizes real life COVID-19 and climate data to analyze trends and create predictive models.

# Initial Questions

Our initial questions involved looking deeper into trends in COVID-19 over the year and how those trends were affected by climate. We also wanted to see what the case counts might look like in the future based on the data that we have. To answer these broader questions, we divided into multiple smaller sections to better address more specific questions. For more information on what these initial questions looked like and how they evolved over time, please click on one of the following:

#### [Interactive Dashboard Visualizations](create_shiny.html)

#### [Regression Analysis](Regression-Analysis.html)



# Data

For each section, COVID-19 data were obtained from the `COVID19` package in R. Additional datasets were utilized for the analysis and are defined in the following reports.

#### [Descriptives](descriptive_plotly.html)

For descriptive visualizations, we retrieved data from the aforementioned COVID19 package in R, JHU CSSE database, and the sars2pack from GitHub along with two locally created datasets with date of mask mandate per state and important national events. 

#### [Interactive Dashboard Visualizations](create_shiny.html)

For interactive dashboard visualizations, we retrieved our data from the COVID19 package in R as well as the rnoaa dataset.

#### [Regression Analysis](Regression-Analysis.html)


For the regression analysis we used the COVID package in R and the noaa data. We created a separate noaa dataset for the regression analysis pulling in the variables we are interested in to help us build the prediction models and the predictive tool. 

# Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis was done in [Descriptives](descriptive_plotly.html) as well as [Interactive Dashboard Visualizations](create_shiny.html). 

The purpose and results were to see whether there are any differences between new daily COVID cases and deaths between states that are temperate and sub-tropical, red/blue states as per 2020 election, and between US cities among those are most populated compared to 10 randomly selected less populated counties. Additionally the interactive dashboard explored the data individually focusing on COVID data and climate data. 

Our results show that COVID cases dropped from April to May, but increased again in the summer, before decreasing in August and September, and peaking again as we got closer to the winter. We see that COVID death peaked at the beginning of the pandemic around March and April before decreasing. The pattern of COVID cases is similar between sub-tropical and temperate states, but the total count in cases in sub-tropical states is slightly higher and fluctuates more, with similar observations for COVID deaths. Patterns or populated cities and less populated counties are similar, however peak for COVID cases and deaths are more pronounced for populated cities. From our visualizations, COVID cases and deaths do not seem to be responsive to national events. However, as we move into the winter months, cases and deaths are increasing, but we are not sure if that is a result of the national events in the fall and winter.

The interactive dashboard showed that the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths have increased over time since January 2020 up till October 2020. However, the rate at which cases are increasing are much faster than the rate at which deaths are increasing, as shown by the graphs in the first tab in the interactive dashboard. COVID-19 hospitalization cases fluctuate over time from state to state, so no conclusive trends can be assumed from the data that we have on COVID-19 hospitalizations. When looking at trends for temperature for each state, we see a similar trend in each state showing an increase in temperature (minimum/maximum/average) from January 2020 till August 2020, and then a decrease in temperatures going into October 2020. 

### Predictive Models

We wanted to see the relationship between COVID-19 and climate - more specifically if the case counts is related to rise in temperature. We decided to build three models - 
The first model assess the relationship between covid-19 case counts and temperature. 
The second model assess the relationship between covid-19 case counts, temperature and its relation to school closures, work place closures and gathering restrictions. 
The third model assess the relationship between covid-19 case counts and temperature and its relation to public health discourse and policies. 

### Interactive Predictive Tool

We went on to build a predictive tool which allows you to choose the temperature in the State that you are curious about and allows you to predict the case counts. The interactive map would display the predicted count. 

Our second interactive predictive tools allows you to predict the case counts based on school closures, work place closures and gathering restrictions. 

The third map predicts covid case counts based on the travel restrictions. 

# Discussion
include formal discussion that is a combination of all the conclusions from other sections
